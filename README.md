MindDump is a quick note‑taking plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It helps you capture fleeting thoughts, jot down ideas, and manage fragmented notes with ease. Features like nested tags, file attachments, a calendar overview, full‑text search, and seamless Markdown rendering make it a perfect fit for your Obsidian workflow.

## 8 ❓ FAQ

**Q: Attachment upload fails or filenames conflict?**  
A: The plugin automatically generates unique filenames based on the date and sequence number and checks for existing files to avoid overwrites. If the problem persists, please check folder permissions or contact the developer.

**Q: What if I need spaces in a tag?**  
A: Tags cannot contain spaces. Use `/` to create nested tags (e.g., `Work/Important`).

**Q: How can I import existing notes into MindDump?**  
A: There is currently no direct import, but you can copy and paste the content into the Quick Capture modal.

**Q: The calendar doesn’t show all entries?**  
A: Ensure your note files are stored in the configured save folder. Try reloading the plugin or restarting Obsidian.
